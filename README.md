# NASA Asteroids

This is the start of Java project that uses the [Nasa Asteroid - NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API](https://api.nasa.gov).

## Description

The program gets data from the Nasa Asteroid - NeoWs API on a daily basis, per the given date. Then this data is stored in a MySQL database. The closest object to earth is found among the data based on today's date and that information is then tweeted at [@closestAsteroid](https://twitter.com/closestAsteroid).

Here is a high level look at the program.
