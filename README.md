# NASA Asteroids

This is the start of Java project that uses the Nasa Asteroid - NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API. 

## Description

Still in testing, development.

At a high level, the program gets data from the Nasa Asteroid - NeoWs API on a daily basis, per the given date. Then this data is stored. The closest object to earth is found among the data based on today's date and that information is tweeted at @closestAsteroid.
